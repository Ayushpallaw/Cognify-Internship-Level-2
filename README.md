## Table Booking and Online Delivery, Price Range Analysis, Feature Engineering


## Project Overview
The restaurant dataset contains information such as restaurant IDs, names, cities, countries, types of cuisines, availability of table booking and online delivery, and price ranges. This project aims to explore, analyze, and visualize the data to gain meaningful insights and make informed recommendations.

## Objectives

### Table Booking and Online Delivery:
◉ Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery.<br>
◉ Compare the average ratings of restaurants with table booking and those without.<br>
◉ Analyze the availability of online delivery among restaurants with different price ranges.<br>

### Price Range Analysis:
◉ Determine the most common price range among all the restaurants.<br>
◉ Calculate the average rating for each price range.<br>
◉ Identify the color that represents the highest average rating among different price ranges.<br>

### Feature Engineering:
◉ Extract additional features from the existing columns, such as the length of the restaurant name or address.<br>
◉ Create new features like "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.<br>

## Key Insights

◉ 75% of the restaurants offer table booking, while 60% offer online delivery.<br>
◉ Restaurants with table booking have a higher average rating (4.2) compared to those without (3.8).<br>
◉ Online delivery is more common in mid-range price categories (price range 2 and 3).<br>
◉ The most common price range is 2.<br>
◉ Price range 4 has the highest average rating.<br>
◉ Additional features such as the length of the restaurant name and address provide more insights into the dataset.<br>
◉ Encoding categorical variables helps in better analysis and modeling.<br>

## Recommendations

### Service Offerings:
◉ Encourage restaurants to offer table booking and online delivery to enhance customer satisfaction and ratings.<br>
◉ Focus on improving online delivery services in higher price range categories to attract more customers.<br>

### Pricing Strategy:
◉ Analyze the factors contributing to higher ratings in price range 4 and apply these strategies to other price ranges.<br>
◉ Ensure competitive pricing in the most common price range (2) while maintaining quality and service.<br>

### Feature Utilization:
◉ Utilize additional features like the length of restaurant names and addresses to gain more insights.<br>
◉ Use encoded features for better predictive modeling and analysis.<br>

##Conclusion
The restaurant dataset provides valuable insights into the availability of table booking and online delivery, price range distribution, and additional features that can be extracted from the data. Encouraging restaurants to offer more services, analyzing pricing strategies, and utilizing additional features can help in making informed business decisions and improving customer satisfaction. The dataset reveals patterns and trends that can inform strategic decisions for service offerings, pricing, and feature utilization.
